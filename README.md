# ICU Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting and analyzing ICU-related outcomes. The project is structured to handle tasks such as feature engineering, regression, classification, clustering, and association rule mining.

## Project Contents

- **`codebase/`**: Contains the main project files, including the machine learning pipeline and dataset.
  - `ml_pipeline.py`: The core script implementing the machine learning pipeline.
  - `dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and analysis.
  - `README.md`: Detailed instructions for running the project.
  - `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

- **`Advancing_ICU_Resource_Planning.pdf`**: A document providing additional analysis related to the results derived from the project.

## Navigation

1. Start by reading the `codebase/README.md` for detailed instructions on prerequisites, data preparation, and execution phases.
2. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
3. Follow the execution phases outlined in the `codebase/README.md` to run the pipeline step by step.

This project is designed to provide insights into ICU resource planning and patient outcomes using advanced machine learning techniques.
